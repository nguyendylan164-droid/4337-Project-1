As far as I understand, this project is creating a prefix-notation calculator using Racket which is a functional programming language.
I can either choose to run the program in two modes: interactive and batch.
Currently, I am leaning towards running the program in interactive mode first, in order to test expressions.
Once interactive mode works I plan to switch to batch mode.

I plan to layout the functions I will need and work on them one by one.
I'm choosing to start with defining the main loop and eval-expr function which will do the actual calculations.

This session proved to be quite challenging, because I am not familiar with racket.
Transitioning from programming in imperative languages to a functional language is quite difficult, because they are more different than I thought. I realize now that I have to think more functionally.

Today, I plan to better familiarize myself with racket before I actually start working on the project.

I finished my main loop, now I have to implement the calculation functions.

I am going to start implementing the calculation functions, which I think is the most difficult part.
