As far as I understand, this project is creating a prefix-notation calculator using Racket which is a functional programming language.
I can either choose to run the program in two modes: interactive and batch.
Currently, I am leaning towards running the program in interactive mode first, in order to test expressions.
Once interactive mode works I plan to switch to batch mode.

Today, I am going to begin working on the project I plan to layout the functions I need to use and work from there.
