As far as I understand, this project is creating a prefix-notation calculator using Racket which is a functional programming language.
I can either choose to run the program in two modes: interactive and batch.
Currently, I am leaning towards running the program in interactive mode first, in order to test expressions.
Once interactive mode works I plan to switch to batch mode.

Session 1

3:48 PM
I plan to layout the functions I will need and work on them one by one.
I'm choosing to start with implementing the main loop and "evaluate-expression" function which will do the actual calculations.
11:12 PM
This session I failed to meet my goal of implementing the main loop and "evaluate-expression" function. 
Transitioning from programming in imperative languages to a functional language is proving difficult, because they are more different than I thought. Next session I plan to better familiarize myself with racket by watching videos and following the racket guide.

Session 2

10:51 AM
This session, I plan to better familiarize myself with racket before I actually start working on the project.
2:15 PM
I watched some videos on racket and I was able to finished my main loop even though it wasn't a part of the goal.
Next, I plan to implement the calculation functions which I think will be the hardest part.

Session 3
10/16/2025
3:45 PM
I am going to start implementing the calculation functions.
I'm starting with the "evaluate-expression" and then laying out the other functions that I will need with "evaluate-expression".
10/16/2025
8:47 PM
I finished the "evaluate-expression" function and layed out more functions: "parse-expression" and "skip-whitespace".
Next session I will finish the "parse-expression" and "skip-whitespace" functions.
